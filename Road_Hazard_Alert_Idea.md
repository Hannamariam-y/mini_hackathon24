Project Proposal: Real-Time Road Hazard Alert System
Hello and welcome to my submission for Mini Hackathon 24! I’m excited to share my idea for a system designed to improve road safety. This project focuses on creating a technology that detects road hazards—like construction zones or accidents—and sends real-time alerts to drivers.

How It Works: The system uses signals to identify potential dangers and notifies drivers within a distance of 1 to 10 kilometers. Alerts can come in the form of sounds in the vehicle or notifications on the driver’s phone. This early warning gives drivers the chance to slow down, change lanes, or take an alternate route, helping to prevent accidents and ease traffic congestion.

Key Benefits
Enhances Road Safety: Early warnings provide drivers with more time to react to hazards, promoting safer driving.
Reduces Traffic Congestion: By allowing drivers to plan alternative routes, the system helps to alleviate traffic buildup.
Encourages Open-Source Collaboration: This project embraces open-source principles, inviting contributions and improvements from others in the community!
Imagine a car equipped with technology that can "see" road issues before you reach them. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it works: the system listens for signals indicating road problems ahead. Once it detects a hazard, it instantly sends a warning to any drivers nearby.

The alert could be an audible sound in the vehicle or a message on their phone, informing them of the issue ahead. This gives drivers valuable time to prepare, reducing the chances of sudden stops, lane changes, or traffic jams.
